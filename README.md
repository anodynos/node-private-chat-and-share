# node-private-chat-and-share
Just another webchat app for two users to privately chat and share files

This is just another complete example of a simple  old private webchat
between two users with an added functionality of sharing files while chatting.
A very good reference for those learning node.js, express and socket.io

To build the dependencies simply run

	- npm install
